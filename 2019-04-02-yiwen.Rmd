## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r}
x4 <- c(1,5,8)
y4 <- c(5,8)

x4 %in% y4
```
```{r}
x5 <- c("台北市","新北市","高雄市")
y5 <- c("台北市","新北市")

x5 %in% y5
```



```{r}
library(readr)
exData2 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpemartin/github-data/master/exData2.csv")
currency <- exData2$幣別
```
